Engineer Project:

We want you to start an API Server that could be used for a social media website. This includes modeling users and a “friend” relationship between users.

Core Features:
- Using a relational database (MySQL, Postgres), create the schema needed for users and to model the friend relationship
  - Keep the user model simple! Id, firstName, and lastName are perfect
- Create an API Endpoint for fetching users with basic pagination
- Create an API Endpoint for fetching a user’s friends
- Create an API Endpoint for fetching a user’s friends of friends
- Start a README with your code - Make sure that it provides the instructions to be able to run the application.
Other requirements:
- Document how to migrate the database to your schema, whether it is an accompanying SQL command or a migration tool.
- Document how to test the API Endpoints, i.e. with Postman
- Document briefly how you would write unit or integration tests.
- Use any routing library you feel comfortable with (i.e. Express, Koa, restify)
- Follow REST conventions
Deliverables
- The above project should not take more than a couple of hours. We are looking for clean and concise code and to continue the discussion with you after you submit the project. Please include a ZIP file or a link to a public repo.
